# Machine_learning
implementation of machine learning algorithms
There will be two parts to this repository: high-level and from-scratch implementations.
+ High-level implementations will implement various machine learning algorithms using other libraries such as pytorch and scikit-learn.
+ From-scratch implemnetations will be aimed at understanding the inner-working of high-level implemented algorithms 

## High-level implementation
+ General pytorch
+ Datasets and Dataloaders
+ Optimizing a function using pytorch
+ Shallow neural networks
+ Deep neural networks
+ Convolutional neural networks
+ Recurrent neural networks
+ Self-orgarnizing networks
+ Boltzmann machines
+ Autoencoders
+ Physics-informed neural networks
+ Graph-neural networks
+ Special architectures
  + Resnets
  + Densenets
  + Transformers

## From-scratch implementation
+ Gradient-descent
+ activation functions
++ Sigmoid
++ Tanh
++ ReLU and varients
+ optimizers
++ Adam and varients
++ Stochastic gradient descent (SGD)
+ Batch normalization
+ Shallow nerual networks
+ Convolutional neural networks
